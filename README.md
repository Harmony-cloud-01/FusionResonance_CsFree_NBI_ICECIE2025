The study presents a caesium-free, magnetically enhanced negative-ion source for neutral beam injection (NBI) systems in fusion reactors such as ITER, DEMO, and JT-60SA.  
A transverse magnetic filter (TMF) creates a cold-electron pocket that improves dissociative attachment efficiency while eliminating Cs contamination, enabling **12–18 % gain** at lab scale and **~15 % gain** in reactor extrapolations.
